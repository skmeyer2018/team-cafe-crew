Ingredients
2 Tablespoons olive oil
4 strips of turkey bacon chopped
2 cloves garlic minced
1 very large bunch collard greens stemmed and sliced into bite size strips
1 cup low sodium chicken stock plus extra if needed
3 Tablespoons cider vinegar
1 Tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Salt to taste
Cooking Steps
Heat the oil on medium heat in a medium size sauce pan. Add the bacon and sauté for a few minutes or until starting to crisp, then set aside on paper towels, leaving the oil in the pan.
Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add the collard greens and cook until they begin to wilt.
Pour in the stock, vinegar, sugar and pepper. Cover and lower the heat to a simmer. Let cook until the greens are tender, about 40 minutes.
Uncover, add the bacon, raise the heat to medium-high, and reduce the liquid until there is barely any left. Season with salt if necessary.
