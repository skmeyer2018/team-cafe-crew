Ingredients
2 cups olive oil
2 cups A1 steak sauce
2 large onions, coarsely chopped
1 bunch fresh rosemary sprigs
1 bunch fresh thyme sprigs
10 cloves garlic, smashed
2 18 ounce beef ribeye steaks
1/4 cup sea salt
1/4 cup coarsely ground black pepper
Cooking Steps
For the marinade, in a large bowl combine the oil, steak sauce, onions, rosemary, thyme, and garlic.
Place the steaks in a resealable bag, set in a shallow bowl. Pour marinade over the steaks. Seal bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours, turning occasionally.
 Drain steaks; discard marinade. Generously season steaks with the sea salt and the coarse black pepper.
Preheat grill. Place steaks on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals. Grill for 15 to 19 minutes for medium-rare (145°F) or 18 to 20 minutes for medium (160°F), turning once.
